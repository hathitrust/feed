    my $string = <<'YAML';
    ---

    YAML

    # Load the YAML::AppConfig from the given YAML.
    my $conf = YAML::AppConfig->new(string => $string);

    # Get settings in two different ways, both equivalent:
    $conf->get("etc_dir");    # returns /opt/etc
    $conf->get_etc_dir;       # returns /opt/etc

    # Get raw settings (with no interpolation) in three equivalent ways:
    $conf->get("etc_dir", 1); # returns '$root_dir/etc'
    $conf->get_etc_dir(1);    # returns '$root_dir/etc'
    $conf->config->{etc_dir}; # returns '$root_dir/etc'

    # Set etc_dir in three different ways, all equivalent.

    # Changing a setting can affect other settings:

    $config->set_var_dir('/var/');  # change var_dr, which var2_dir uses.
    $config->get_var2_dir;          # returns /var2

    # Variables are dynamically scoped:
    $config->get_libs->{perl}->{vendor};  # returns "/opt/usr/lib/perl"

    # As seen above, variables are live and not static:

    $config->resolve('rm -fR $root_dir'); # returns "rm -fR /opt"

    # Variables can be escaped, to avoid accidental interpolation:
    $config->get_escape_example();  # returns "/opt/$var_dir/\$var_dir"

    # Merge in other configurations:
    my $yaml =<<'YAML';
    ---
    root_dir: cows
    foo: are good
    YAML
    $config->merge(string => $yaml);
    $config->get_root_dir();  # returns "cows"
    $config->get_foo();  # returns "are good"

    # Get the raw YAML for your current configuration:
    $config->dump();  # returns YAML as string
    $config->dump("./conf.yaml");  # Writes YAML to ./conf.yaml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<YAML::AppConfig> extends the work done in L<Config::YAML> and
L<YAML::ConfigFile> to allow more flexiable configuration files.

Your configuration is stored in YAML and then parsed and presented to you via
L<YAML::AppConfig>.  Settings can be referenced using C<get> and C<set>
methods and settings can refer to one another by using variables of the form
C<$foo>, much in the style of C<AppConfig>.  See B<USING VARIABLES> below for
more details.

The underlying YAML parser is either L<YAML>, L<YAML::Syck> or one of your
chosing.  See B<THE YAML LIBRARY> below for more information on how a YAML
parser is picked.

=head1 THE YAML LIBRARY

At this time there are two API compatible YAML libraries for Perl.  L<YAML>
and L<YAML::Syck>.  L<YAML::AppConfig> chooses which YAML parser to use as
follows:

=over

=item yaml_class

If C<yaml_class> is given to C<new> then it used above all other
considerations.  You can use this to force use of L<YAML> or L<YAML::Syck>
when L<YAML::AppConfig> isn't using the one you'd like.  You can also use it
specify your own YAML parser, as long as it's API compatiable with L<YAML> and
L<YAML::Syck>.

=item The currently loaded YAML Parser

If you don't specify C<yaml_class> then L<YAML::AppConfig> will default to
using an already loaded YAML parser, e.g. one of L<YAML> or L<YAML::Syck>.  If
both are loaded then L<YAML::Syck> is preferred.

=item An installed YAML Parser.

If no YAML parser has already been loaded then L<YAML::AppConfig> will attempt
to load L<YAML::Syck> and failing that it will attempt to load L<YAML>.  If
both fail then L<YAML::AppConfig> will C<croak> when you create a new object
instance.

=over

=head1 USING VARIABLES

=head2 Variable Syntax

Variables refer to other settings inside the configuration file.
L<YAML::AppConfig> variables have the same form as scalar variables in Perl.
That is they begin with a dollar sign and then start with a letter or an
underscore and then have zero or more letters, numbers, or underscores which
follow.  For example, C<$foo>, C<$_bar>, and C<$cat_3> are all valid variable
names.

Variable names can also be contained in curly brackets so you can have a
variable side-by-side with text that might otherwise be read as the name of
the variable itself.  For example, C<${foo}bar> is the the variable C<$foo>
immediately followed by the literal text C<bar>.  Without the curly brackets
L<YAML::AppConfig> would assume the variable name was C<$foobar>, which is
incorrect.

Variables can also be escaped by using backslashes.  The text C<\$foo> will
resolve to the literal string C<$foo>.  Likewise C<\\$foo> will resolve to the
literal string C<\$foo>, and so on.

=head2 Variable Scoping

YAML is essentially a serialization language and so it follows that your
configuration file is just an easy to read serialization of some data
structure.  L<YAML::AppConfig> assumes the top most data structure is a hash
and that variables are keys in that hash, or in some hash contained within.

If every hash in the configuration file is thought of as a namespace then the
variables can be said to be dynamically scoped.  For example, consider the
following configuration file:

    ---
    foo: world
    bar: hello
    baz:
        - $foo
        - {foo: dogs, cats: $foo}
        - $foo $bar
    qux:
        quack: $baz
        
In this sample configuration the array contained by C<$baz> has two elements.
The first element resolves to the value C<hello>, the second element resolves
to the value "dogs", and the third element resolves to C<hello world>.

=head2 Variable Resolving

Variables can also refer to entire data structures.  For example, C<$quack>
will resolve to the same three element array as C<$baz>.  However, YAML
natively gives you this ability and then some.  So consider using YAML's
ability to take references to structures if L<YAML::AppConfig> is not
providing enough power for your use case.

In a L<YAML::AppConfig> object the variables are not resolved until you
retrieve the variable (e.g. using C<get()>.  This allows you to change
settings which are used by other settings and update many settings at once.
For example, if I call C<set("baz", "cows")> then C<get("quack")> will resolve
to C<cows>.

If a variable can not be resolved because it doesn't correspond to a key
currently in scope then the variable will be left verbatim in the text.
Consider this example:

    ---
    foo:
        bar: food
    qux:
        baz: $bar
        qix: $no_exist

In this example C<$baz> resolves to the literal string C<$bar> since C<$bar> is
not visible within the current scope where C<$baz> is used.  Likewise, C<$qix>
resolves to the literal string C<$no_exist> since there is no key in the
current scope named C<no_exist>.

=head2 To do

possibly use Kwalify for schema checking
allow mass loading of config files
define syntax for deep config queries
raise_error => 1 or similar option to die on failure to resolve query
consider adding deep merge option
come up with a new name and move to CPAN

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(%args)

Creates a new YAML::AppConfig object and returns it.  new() accepts the
following key values pairs:

=over 8

=item file

The name of the file which contains your YAML configuration.

=item string

A string containing your YAML configuration.

=item object

A L<YAML::AppConfig> object which will be deep copied into your object.

=item no_resolve

If true no attempt at variable resolution is done on calls to C<get()>.

=item yaml_class

The name of the class we should use to find our C<LoadFile> and C<Load>
functions for parsing YAML files and strings, respectively.  The named class
should provide both C<LoadFile> and C<Load> as functions and should be loadable
via C<require>.

=back

=head2 get(key, [no_resolve])

Given C<$key> the value of that setting is returned, same as C<get_$key>.  If
C<$no_resolve> is true then the raw value associated with C<$key> is returned,
no variable interpolation is done.

It is assumed that C<$key> refers to a setting at the top level of the
configuration file.

=head2 set(key, value)

The setting C<$key> will have its value changed to C<$value>.  It is assumed
that C<$key> refers to a setting at the top level of the configuration file.

=head2 get_*([no_resolve])

Convenience methods to retrieve values using a method, see C<get>.  For
example if C<foo_bar> is a configuration key in top level of your YAML file
then C<get_foo_bar> retrieves its value.  These methods are curried versions
of C<get>.  These functions all take a single optional argument,
C<$no_resolve>, which is the same as C<get()'s> C<$no_resolve>.

=head2 set_*(value)

Convience methods to set values using a method, see C<set> and C<get_*>.
These methods are curried versions of C<set>.

=head2 config

Returns the hash reference to the raw config hash.  None of the values are
interpolated, this is just the raw data.

=head2 config_keys

Returns the keys in C<config()> sorted from first to last.

=head2 merge(%args)

Merge takes another YAML configuration and merges it into this one.  C<%args>
are the same as those passed to C<new()>, so the configuration can come from a
file, string, or existing L<YAML::AppConfig> object.

=head2 resolve($scalar)

C<resolve()> runs the internal parser on non-reference scalars and returns the
result.  If the scalar is a reference then it is deep copied and a copy is
returned where the non-reference leaves of the data struture are parsed and
replaced as described in B<USING VARIABLES>.

=head2 dump([$file])

Serializes the current configuration using the YAML parser's Dump or, if
C<$file> is given, DumpFile functions.  No interpolation is done, so the
configuration is saved raw.  Things like comments will be lost, just as they
would if you did C<Dump(Load($yaml))>, because that is what what calling
C<dump()> on an instantiated object amounts to.
