<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<h2>System</h2>
Feed is supported on Linux (RedHat, CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu) and Mac OS X.
Other Linux distributions should work but have not been tested. Microsoft
Windows and other non-Unix-like operating systems will
not be supported. Feed requires Perl v5.8.8 or later.

For Mac OS X, you must install XCode from the Mac App Store before attempting
to install feed. Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) should also be
installed.

For Debian/Ubuntu, the "build-essential" package should be installed. For
RedHat/CentOS, the gcc, gcc-c++ and make packages should be installed. 

<h2>Perl Modules</h2>
The following Perl modules are required for Feed; these can be installed from
CPAN. Many of these may also be available through the operating system package
manager.

- Algorithm::LUHN
- Any::Moose
- Data::UUID
- Date::Manip
- Date::Parse
- File::Pairtree
- Filesys::Df
- Image::ExifTool
- LWP
- List::MoreUtils
- Log::Log4perl
- MailTools
- Readonly
- XML::LibXML
- YAML::Any

<h2>Other Software</h2>

Feed depends on the following external software:

- JHOVE 1.5
- ImageMagick 
- Xerces-C 3.1
- SQLite3
- Kakadu 6.4.0 or later (optional: for converting TIFFs to JPEG2000 images)

JHOVE 1.5 must be installed. No other version is supported.  You can get JHOVE
1.5 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jhove/files/jhove/JHOVE%201.5/ JHOVE
requires that Java be installed. JHOVE 1.5 will not work out of the box -- you
must edit the sample 'jhove' script to point to your local installation of
Java.


The ImageMagick and Xerces-C libraries must be installed as well. 

For ImageMagick:

On RedHat/CentOS:

   yum install ImageMagick

On Debian/Ubuntu:

   apt-get install imagemagick

On Mac OS X with HomeBrew:

   brew install ImageMagick


For Xerces-C:

On RedHat/CentOS: 

   yum install xerces-c libxerces-c-3_1 xerces-c-devel

On Debian/Ubuntu:

   apt-get install libxerces-c3.1 libxerces-c3-dev

On Mac OS X with Homebrew:

   brew install xerces-c


Finally, sqlite3 must be installed. It is installed by default
on recent versions of Mac OS X.

On RedHat/CentOS:

   yum install sqlite

On Debian/Ubuntu:

   apt-get install sqlite3


Kakadu (for converting TIFFs to JPEG2000 images) is optional. Kakadu is
commercial software that requires a license. Obtaining and installing Kakadu is
outside the scope of this document. If you wish to use Kakadu with feed, set
the path to kdu_compress in feed's configuration file (see 'Configuration'
below).

<h1>Installation</h1>
Download and unzip the the Feed tarball
cd HTFeed-vX.X.X
perl Makefile.PL
make
sudo make install

By default, feed installs files to the following locations:

/usr/local/share # HTFeed and METS namespace perl modules
/usr/local/bin/ # ingest_test test_stage validate_images
/usr/local/etc/feed/ # Feed config files
/usr/local/var/feed/ # Feed sqlite database

Before using feed, make sure that /usr/local/bin/ is in your $PATH.
You will also need to make sure that all files and directories under
/usr/local/var/feed are writable by the user you will be running feed as.

If you install to a different location using the PREFIX option for Makefile.PL,
ensure that the alternate lib location is in your PERL5LIB environment
variable.

<h1>Configuration</h1>

Configuration files are installed in the config directory under Feed's etc
directory (by default this is /usr/local/etc/feed). If Feed and its scripts are
properly installed (by default in /usr/local/bin) "feed_env.pl feed_etc" will
print the configured location of this directory.

The config files include comments on what settings do and how to edit them. We
recommended making local configuration changes in a separate file (e.g.
/usr/local/etc/feed/config/02_local_config.yml). All config files must end in
".yml". Files are loaded in alphabetical order.

Before running feed, review the configuration files and edit the settings as
described in each file.
